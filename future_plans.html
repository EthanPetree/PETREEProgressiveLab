            <p>The number one thing that I imagine most people will do is try to
                get a job after they graduate, and I am no different. I will
                want to immediately start working on paying off my loans as i've
                seen just how bad debt accrual is. I first need to save up
                enough to have enough money to last about 2 months, think of it
                like an emergency fund. After that I will be able to work on my
                debt and get rid of it as fast as possible.</p>

            <p>Sometime during that period I will either have to borrow or buy a
                used car, probably from my parents to get around. I need to find
                a decent place to live, which will depend if and where I get a
                job. My priority will be my mental health over my workload and
                maybe I'll get a chance to start a family or pursue one of my
                hobbies a lot more.</p>
